In any web application, login authentication plays an important role because it ensures that only authorized users can access the system. This login page is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to collect user credentials in a simple and user-friendly format. The HTML part creates the structure of the form including fields for email and password, a “Remember Me” option, and a login button. This helps users enter their details easily while maintaining a clean and clear layout.
The CSS styling makes the page visually appealing through a dark theme background and a card-style layout at the center of the screen. Input boxes, buttons, and text are styled with gradients and shadows to give a modern, professional look similar to real production login systems. The design also supports responsive behavior so the page adjusts properly even on mobile screens. This enhances the user experience and ensures accessibility across different devices.
The JavaScript code is responsible for the login validation and basic fake authentication process. First, it checks if the entered email format is valid and whether the password has the required number of characters. Then, it compares the typed details with demo credentials to simulate login functionality. If the login is correct, a success message is displayed and a fake token is stored in either localStorage or sessionStorage depending on the “Remember Me” option. This represents how a real authentication flow works in web applications, where user data is verified before granting access.
